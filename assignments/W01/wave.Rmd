#Wave Plot

This document demonstrates how to creat plots and mathematical formule

## Creating the Data

```{r}
x = seq(0,20,0.01)
y = sin(x)
sin_df = data.frame(x,y)

head(sin_df, 3)
```

```{r}
plot(sin_df$x,sin_df$y,
     type = "l",
     main = "Sine Wave",
     xlab = "x",
     ylab = "sin(x)",
     col = "blue")
```

The fundamental trigonometric identity:
$$sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1$$
